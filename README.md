:book: **I'm an electrical student residing in Slovenia, graduated in highschool and am certified to work in electronic environment.**

## Qualifications
[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=DemsarMa&layout=compact)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I am qualified in various languages and IDEs:
- JavaScript
- Python (basic)
- Bash
- Arduino
- C (basic)
- English with B1 certificate (does that count? :joy:)

Also qualified in IT environment, I can work with servers with Linux and manage them, both hardware and software.

## Goals

I want to obtain a CCNA or CCIE certificate and then be able to work in a datacenter or as an IT technician. You're probably wondering, why choosing this over a job, that is "electrical" focused? Simply because I can combine both of them into a single branch.

I highly believe my server infrastructure is non-professional and needs a professional lookup by someone, who is above my level and can advise.

## Hobbies

I'm my free time, I like to manage my Minecraft network ArtUnionMC and work with Minecraft related things.

My Minecraft network is located in 2 different locations:

- thisisartunion.com (Europe)
- ap.thisisartunion.com (Asia and Oceania)

I'm streaming as well on Twitch I guess (sometimes...)
